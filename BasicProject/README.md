### Creating the project

Creating a new application project with the *app* template

```sh
$ mkdir BasicProject

$ cd BasicProject

$ lein new app BasicProject
Project names containing uppercase letters are not recommended
and will be rejected by repositories like Clojars and Central.
If you're truly unable to use a lowercase name, please set the
LEIN_BREAK_CONVENTION environment variable and try again.

$ lein new app basicproject
Generating a project called basicproject based on the 'app' template.

$ cd basicproject/
```

A snapshot of the directory structure and the content generated by the *app* template:

![](_misc/Project%20structure%20created%20using%20app%20template.PNG)

The default configuration file generated has the following content:

*basicproject/project.clj*

```clj
(defproject basicproject "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]]
  :main ^:skip-aot basicproject.core
  :target-path "target/%s"
  :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})
```

The configuration file contains a single call to *defproject*, which is defined by *lein* DSL. The *defproject* call accepts a number of the following parameters: 

1. Project name
2. Project Version
3. A number of keyword parameters

The first parameter passed is the name of the project 'basicproject'.
The second parameter is the version number '0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'. The 'SNAPSHOT' in the version implies that the version is not released and might not be official. 
The following parameters after the version number parameter are the keyword parameters. These include

* description
* url
* license
* dependencies: where the JAR dependencies that should be downloaded from a Maven repository needs to be specified.
* main
* target-path
* profiles
